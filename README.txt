This is our Capstone Project that is a class builder for the popular MMORPG Monster Hunter Worlds. 
It will take in data from the Monster Hunter Worlds game by using an API. We will then display that information in diffrent tabs that show items/monster
stats. Next there will be a login feature that allows users to login so they can access the actuall class builder. Once a user logs-in they can now add weapons, armours,
and charms to their inventory screen. This will let them keep track of what weapons/armours they do and dont have. Users will also be able to click on a build option for
a monster and we will give them the best possible build they can use for that monster with their current inventory and then the best possible build you can get in the game.
Next users will be able to share their builds with other fellow users by posting it to a builder share page. Users will also be able to comment on other users build.
